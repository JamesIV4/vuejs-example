# vuejs-example
This is a component I created at WebMD.

## Overview
- Dynamic navigation component with dropdown menus
- Populated via a config JSON object, supplied through the CMS.
- Behaves responsively, converting into a hamburger menu on mobile, and the nav slides in from the left.
- Design is purposly generic, ready for overrides for client-specific builds.
- Test URL shows a variety of possible scenarios. Some links have sub-navs, some do not. Showing with and without images too.
